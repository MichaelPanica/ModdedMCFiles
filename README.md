Installation steps for Modded Minecraft (Enigmatica 6)

# STEPS - READ ME MOTHERFUCKER
1. First you have to install CurseForge. Click on https://download.curseforge.com/ , and select Windows / macOS (deppending on your OS - but who tf plays on mac lmao -- just choose windows)
2. Once the .exe has downloaded, click on it and install Curseforge.
3. Make sure you have a VANILLA MINECRAFT installed. Either cracked or paid Minecraft (minecraft.net = Paid/Original. 
4.      (If you wanna get it cracked, use TLauncher). On Cracked Minecraft you will be able to play ONLY on servers that disabled the public feature (cracked servers). On Paid Minecraft you can play on any server + use skins.
5. After having Vanilla Minecraft + Curseforge installed, make sure you download the Modded Minecraft Profile-1.0.0 from this page. Click on download > as a zip. Put it wherever you want
6.      but keep in mind where you put it, cause we're gonna need it later.
7. Open CurseForge App (normally it should be on your desktop). 
8. Once you open it, select Minecraft, and once in My Modpacks, click (+ Create Custom Profile) > _import_ (it should be below Create Profile title.)
9. Go to the location you've downloaded the _Modded Minecraft Profile-1.0.0.zip_. Select it, and import it by clicking _Open_.
10. Wait for it to install. _Grab a cup 'a coffa' and smoke a fag_
11. Once installed, click Play. The vanilla minecraft launcher will pop up. Login. Click start/play whatever it says.
12. Wait for the game too boot up and load.
13. Done. You can play single player or multiplayer. 
14. If you wanna play multiplayer, click on multiplayer (duh), Add Server -> Server Address - Put in the servers IP > start the game. 
15.         The modded Minecraft wont work on vanilla servers and vice versa. A modpack will work with the same modpack the server has. You can't use a modpack and join a server that uses another modpack. You gotta have the same mods.
16. If you wanna play on vanilla, IN THE VANILLA LAUNCHER, Select the version you wanna play, (or create new profile and select the version from there if it doesnt pop up), and play.
